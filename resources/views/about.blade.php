        <p>Welcome to Dalt Casa, established in November 2016</p>
        <p>We're a collective of artists, DJ's, music fans and we want you to join us.</p>
        <p>We're throwing secret members-only parties in Glasgow and Ibiza. Tune into our radio show on Wednesdays at 10PM GMT on <a href="http://radiomagnetic.com">radiomagnetic.com</a> for full updates on upcoming events as well as guest DJ's.</p>
        <p>Dalt Casa originally started in Dalt Villa, throwing an intimate party every Tuesday in September, under the name "Dalt Mila". With an eclectic, international, and underground line-up, along with a superb crowd - we only thought it was right to bring the brand back home to Scotland for winter - renaming it "Dalt Casa", which in Catalan means "Top House".</p>
